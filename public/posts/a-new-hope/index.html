<p>Have you ever agreed to follow through with the recruitment process of a work place you know you're not gonna like, because you're not in a position where you can allow yourself to be picky? That was me. Not with ATDEV, but another place I was following the process with as a Plan B.</p>
<p>It was a Junior Software Developer position, however it was in a stack I wasn't really excited about. It was on-site, with Saturdays. But anyway, after a huge handicap in their technical test, I knew I wasn't gonna make it in there... and I felt happy about it. However I got back home, tired, knowing that if ATDEV didn't take me in I was going to be back to square one.</p>
<p>Then a random text from Heidy shows up. She was pretty much asking for &quot;You're hired&quot; kind of information. And I couldn't stop smiling the whole time. Knowing that I made the right choice. I immediately texted my mentor about it, and shortly after I got the offer and was told to start on November the 15th. I never felt so happy in my career as I did in that moment... it was all worth it.</p>
