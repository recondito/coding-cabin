<p>Everything started in May the 25th, 2022. At the time I was working from home, however I wasn't a software developer. My previous job was mostly something that I had to do to cover the bills (College, transportation, the gym, etc) and something I've always wanted was to work in my field.</p>
<p>Like any job hunter, I was just sending resumes wherever I could. ATDEV being one of the places, and ofcourse, they quickly replied. I received an email from TestGorilla which I immediately took and almost like clockwork got the email for an interview with Mr. Andres.</p>
<p>What called my attention the most was the location: Coral Mall. As someone that lives in the &quot;Otherside&quot;, that was going to be quite a trip. I remember my partner from back then telling me &quot;You're the crazy one for heading there&quot;. But hey, always worth giving the shot.</p>
<p>The interview was to this day, the best interview. And me and Andres connected very well. However, at the moment the position was On-Site and with the offered salary, I wanted to take it, but due to the expenses that I had to take care of, I wasn't able to, very unfortunately. So we both left it at &quot;I hope we can see eachother again eventually, I really wanted you to work with us&quot;, oh me too... me too...</p>
