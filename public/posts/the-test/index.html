<p>Time called. The famous &quot;Technical Test&quot;. Which was a Salary Discount Calculator. Who wouldn't remember.</p>
<p>Anyway, being completely honest here, I was very rusty in terms of programming. Working on site with my previous schedule really took a lot of my time, energy, and motivation. So the toughest part was mostly refreshing the skills.</p>
<p>I still remember that week. I was getting replies from many many places, but none of them had my attention at this point. I was too focused on the technical test. It was all I could think about, and after all that time, sure it was a challenge, but sure enough I did everything I could. And I wanna give my special thanks to Heidy and her patience and diligence through the whole process.</p>
