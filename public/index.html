                <p>Please take a look at <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/santanalla/developer-diaries">/dev/ - Developer's Diaries</a></strong> to see the project this blog is based on. The sole purpose of the Coding Cabin is to serve as an improved successor of Developer's Diaries. This time using a much better template while keeping the content the same. Also using Sanity instead of Decap CMS.</p>
                <p>This blog was created during my third week of my ATDEV's Internship Program. So far I've been having the time of my life, and this website should serve to document my progress through my time as an intern. I have written more code in three weeks than I've written in the entire year, probably because I'm much more motivated now that I feel like I have a purpose.</p>
                <p>/dev/ - Developer's Diaries was inspired in 4chan's minimalistic and almost "old" web design, along with the naming convention. I'm not a big 4chan user but I'm not gonna lie, the website is really well designed which is what motivated me to base my first iteration of the blog on it. However in a more professional environment, that layout can come off as a little bit "lazy". So this time I chose to use a better looking template.</p>

                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I have been interested in Software Development since the age of 7 but didn't really have the guts to actually code until I was 17. You may be wondering "Why?". And to keep it simple, I just didn't believe in myself. But as time passed I realized "Why do I have to wait until college to start doing the things that I like? It's not like the degree is going to write code."</p> 
                    <p>It all started when I was a kid. I was always too busy in the computer playing videogames, back then, Flash Games. One day out of curiousity I asked "I wonder how do they make video games" to which my aunt replied what in my mind sounded like a bunch of non-sense, then all I heard in the end was "And then programming". That word alone sounded like magic. Which is what that sort of blind admiration for the topic.</p>
                    <p>10 years later and I was playing the mod for the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, known as "San Andreas Multiplayer". I was very active in a server known as "Los Santos Roleplay" and also in the forums, which were made in phpBB (Nostalgia points). I saw that they had developers in the team and so I went ahead and Private Messaged the server owner "What do I have to learn to be able to program a San Andreas Multiplayer server?". To which he replied "Before getting into it I had previous knowledge in Java. However for SAMP what you need to learn is Pawn". And so that was my first contact with software development, learning Pawn to try to make a SAMP Server.</p>
                    <p>I went through many different languages starting with Pawn, learning Python in Codecademy which then turned into Java. Stubborn me however kept hearing the comment "C++ is very hard" so I picked it up cause I'm just cool like that. Stuck with it for the longest time until 2021 which is when I was introduced to JavaScript and by extension ended up going for Backend then Full Stack Web Development. And here we are now.</p>

                                        <h2>/dev/ - Developer's Diaries</h2>
                                        <p>/dev/ - Developer's Diaries is the first project that I made during my first week of my ATDEV Internship. From November 18 to November 22. It was developed mainly with the purpose of putting Eleventy into practice, but it eventually turned into my own self-imposed challenge of making a blog that looks like 4chan.</p>
                                        <p>It went through multiple stages as I originally wanted to use Vue with Eleventy, however with no experience in either, and the original assignment being in Eleventy I decided to just do it in Eleventy. Because of this, I had to go back to square one plenty of times during the development phase.</p>

                                        <h2>Static Pokedex</h2>
                                        <p>I've always been a Pokémon fan. It all started when I was around 5 years old. Had a GameBoy Color with if I remember correctly Pokémon Yellow. Generation 1 isn't necessarily my favorite Generation of the Video Game, but it sure is in the anime.</p>
                                        <p>The reason the Static Pokédex, also using Eleventy, looks so similar to /dev/ - Developer's Diaries is because I wasn't satisfied with the layout for the first blog. I wanted a Grid but I wasn't completely aware of CSS having an actual grid functionality. So I improvised using a flexbox.</p>
                                        <p>Just like Developer's Diaries, I originally wanted to mix it with Vue. But with the main focus being Eleventy, I preferred to continue practicing the tool and worry about Vue later on. That however caused the project to be undone and redone multiple times too.</p>

                                        <p>Time goes by. I almost forgot that I had applied to ATDEV. But there was hope. I got the TestGorilla invitation again! I get notified of this by the recruiter, Heidy Charles. There's a lot of good things I could say about Heidy but they wouldn't fit in a single page.</p>
<p>Anyway, I immediately take the test. Forgot that you had to have the camera enabled and I picked my nose while taking the test, which sure was awkward... but mistakes are to learn from. I submitted my test, and I could do for the rest of the day was daydream about &quot;The Prophecy&quot; actually fulfilling.</p>
